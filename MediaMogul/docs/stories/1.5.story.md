## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1 - Application Bootstrap and Configuration:**
- PhysicalDisk model with user aliases for friendly disk names
- Configuration system for monitored paths

**From Story 1.2 - Physical Disk Discovery and Registration:**
- Disk metadata with device paths and mount points
- Power status integration for disk access decisions

**From Story 1.3 - File System Scanning Engine:**
- Complete File and Folder models with hierarchy relationships
- Database contains full file inventory with metadata
- Relative path structure for efficient navigation
- UTC timestamp storage for all file modification times

**From Story 1.4 - System Dashboard:**

### Data Models
**File Browser View Models** [Derived from Story 1.3 models]
- Uses existing File and Folder models from scanning engine
- No new database tables required - optimized queries on existing schema
- Folder size calculation from aggregated file sizes
- Virtual root navigation combining all monitored disk roots

**Visual Usage Model** [Enhanced for user experience]
- Parent-relative usage calculation: folder_size / parent_total_size * 100
- Disk-level usage calculation: used_space / total_disk_capacity * 100
- Color thresholds: Green (0-49%), Yellow (50-79%), Red (80-100%)
- Usage bar rendering: CSS width percentage with background color coding
- Real-time usage updates when folder sizes change

**Storage Unit Display Model** [Human-readable formatting]
- Automatic unit scaling: bytes → KB → MB → GB → TB based on size magnitude
- Intelligent thresholds: Use higher unit when result is ≥ 1000 (e.g., 1.5 GB vs 1,500 MB)
- Precision rules: 2 decimals for < 10, 1 decimal for 10-99, whole numbers for ≥ 100
- Multiple unit representations: Store bytes, display preferred unit, show all in tooltip
- User preference storage: LocalStorage/cookie for unit display preference
- Consistent formatting: Same logic applied to file sizes, folder sizes, disk capacity

**Timestamp Handling Model** [Enhanced from Story 1.3]
- All timestamps stored as UTC in ISO 8601 format in database
- Browser-side timezone conversion using JavaScript Intl API
