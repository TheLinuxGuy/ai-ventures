# Story: File System Scanning

## Story

As a user,
I want MediaMogul to scan my monitored paths and catalog all files and folders,
so that I have a complete inventory of my media library.

## Acceptance Criteria

### File System Scanning
- [ ] Scan processes all files and folders in monitored paths
- [ ] File metadata captured: name, path, size, modification time with nanosecond precision
- [ ] Folder hierarchy preserved in database
- [ ] Scan respects power-efficient operation (doesn't wake sleeping disks) by default
- [ ] Scan progress reporting and cancellation
- [ ] Incremental scan capability (detect changes since last scan)
- [ ] Large directory handling (thousands of files)

### Timestamp Precision Requirements
- [ ] All file and folder timestamps stored as Unix nanoseconds (UnixNano)
- [ ] Modification time captured with maximum available system precision
- [ ] Creation and access times captured when available on filesystem
- [ ] Timestamp comparison for incremental scans uses nanosecond precision

### Full-Disk Scan Options
- [ ] Users can trigger full-disk scan immediately regardless of sleep state
- [ ] Automatic disk discovery creates opportunistic scan tasks by default
- [ ] Configuration setting to auto-start scans on newly discovered disks vs. queue them
- [ ] Warning dialog when user chooses to scan sleeping disks immediately
- [ ] Opportunistic scan execution when disks become active
