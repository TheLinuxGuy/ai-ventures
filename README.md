# AI ventures

I’ve been in IT for over 15 years, but coding has never really been my thing—it’s always felt like a tedious part of the job. Now that AI tools are getting good enough to handle a lot of that work, I’m finally interested in building stuff without dreading the process.

This repo is a personal, public space where I’m collecting notes, experiments, and thoughts as I explore how to use the latest AI tools to get things done with as little hands-on coding as possible.
