# AI ventures
My personal exploration of AI for use in coding and software development. Although I have been working in IT for over 15+ years, coding or software development has been an area that has never been exciting and always feels like a chore to do, however with AI now becoming able to take these tasks from me it may allow me to no longer need to do the "boring stuff" (coding).

This is a personal public repository of my notes and learnings related to my attempts at using these bleeding edge AI tools and processes to build some stuff.
